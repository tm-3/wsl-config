# WSL Config

This is my basic setup for configuring WSL on Windows 10. It contains all of the scripts and configuration settings I use when working on a new machine. It is meant to be run on a new WSL distribution, but there are some useful utilities included here as well.

All scripts and commands are prefixed with `tm-`. 

## Installation

Clone this repo into a location of your choice. 

```

```

## Scripts

Script|Purpose|Parameters
--|--|---
`init.sh`|Initial setup of the WSL instance. It copies all necessary scripts to `/usr/local/bin`. | -c Copy scripts only. Useful if you already have WSL setup the way you want and just want to use some of the other scripts available.
`update.sh`|Responsible for updating the WSL Instance.|
